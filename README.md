DesignSpark Mechanical is a free, downloadable, 3D solid modeling and assembly tool developed in conjunction with SpaceClaim. But you can buy extensions where you get more functions what you can use it for your project.

But the problem is that you can only use this program on systems that have Windows installed.

And so I got the idea to start this project here to find a way to solve this problem. 

I started looking at different tools and my choice was Wine! 

With this nice tool we don't need longer two operating systems for DesignSpark Mechanical, when we will create a fantastic project! 

Is that a great idea for the future?

Personally, I think this idea is good and for this reason I will do my best to give you the opportunity to use it on Linux as well!
